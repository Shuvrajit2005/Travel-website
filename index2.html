            Known as the Pink City for its distinctly colored buildings, Jaipur is a treasure trove of palaces, forts, and bazaars. The majestic Amber Fort, perched on a hilltop overlooking Maota Lake, offers a glimpse into Rajasthan’s royal heritage. Meanwhile, the City Palace and Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds) showcase the city’s architectural splendor and intricate craftsmanship. Jaipur’s bustling markets are perfect for indulging in traditional textiles, jewelry, and handicrafts.
